# **Capstone 2 Proposals**

## **Proposal 1:  Sentiment analysis on tweets about privacy**
### Use the Twitter API to get tweets and do a sentiment analysis to classify people's level of concern about their privacy into one of three categories: Concerned, Not Concerned, Neutral.  Or choose a privacy related company (Express VPN or ProtonMail) and do a sentiment analysis on tweets about their product.
