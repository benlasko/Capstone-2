# **Capstone 2 Proposals**

## **Proposal 1:  Sentiment analysis on tweets about privacy**
### I'd like to use the Twitter API to get tweets and do a sentiment analysis to classify people's level of concern about their privacy.  Alternatively, I could choose a privacy related company (Express VPN or ProtonMail) and do a sentiment analysis on tweets about their product, classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

## **Proposal 2:  Sentiment analysis on tweets about airlines**
[Airline Tweets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)
### The dataset has about 14,500 tweets about experiences with major airlines.  The tweets are all from February of 2015 and each is classified as positive, negative, or neutral.  I'd like to do a sentiment analysis on the tweets and make a model to predict their category.

## **Proposal 3: Use Census data to predict income**
[Census Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vivamoto/us-adult-income-update)
### The dataset has information on about 49,000 individuals and whether or not they earn more than $50,000 a year.  The goal would be to build a model that correctly predicts whether a person makes over $50,0000 a year based on analysis of 13 features.
